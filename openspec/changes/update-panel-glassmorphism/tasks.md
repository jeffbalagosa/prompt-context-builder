## 1. Spec Updates
- [ ] 1.1 Add a glass panel requirement delta under `visual-theming` describing translucency, blur, and contrast safeguards.

## 2. Implementation
- [ ] 2.1 Update `.structure-panel`, `.builder-panel`, and reusable panel variables in `style.css` to use translucent gradients, frosted blur, and illuminated edges.
- [ ] 2.2 Refresh nested elements (list items, input blocks, buttons) so they inherit the glass aesthetic while preserving readability and focus indicators.

## 3. Validation
- [ ] 3.1 Manually open `index.html`, confirm both panels look like see-through glass across desktop and tablet widths, and ensure text & controls remain legible.
